# Power use area chart
![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is a chart which displays:
* Power use of individual devices in your home as a stacked area chart
* An "envelope" in the background from your main power meter

The goal of this chart is to be able to easily visually correlate changes in power demand over time in your home with individual devices switching on and off.
