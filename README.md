# d3-card for Home Assistant

`d3-card` is a card for Home Assistant dashboards which lets you easily create custom `d3` visualizations of data.

Visualizations are defined as JS code inline in your card YAML config, and are quick and easy to edit and customize.

* See the [docs](https://hansihe.github.io/d3-card/) for API
* See the [examples](examples) folder for examples of usage
  * If you make your own visualization, please consider submitting it as an example using a PR so others can use it :)
* When making your own D3 visualizations, the [D3 examples gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) can be a useful reference. There are also many D3 tutorials online to follow.

See the `examples` folder for visualizations which have been made. If you make your own, please consider contributing it as an example so others can use it :)

Parts of the code for this card has been adapted from [apexcharts-card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card). If you are looking to make powerful charts without having to write code, feel free to check it out.
