# d3-card for Home Assistant

`d3-card` is a card for Home Assistant dashboards which lets you easily create custom `d3` visualizations of data.

Visualizations are defined as JS code inline in your card YAML config, and are quick and easy to edit and customize.

See the `examples` folder for visualizations which have been made. If you make your own, please consider contributing it as an example so others can use it :)

Parts of the code for this card has been adapted from [apexcharts-card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card). If you are looking to make powerful charts without having to write code, feel free to check it out.

## API
This will mainly cover the API of the card itself, not how to use D3 itself. Feel free to check out the [D3 examples gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) or one of the numerous D3 tutorials on the web for help on creating the visualizations themselves.
